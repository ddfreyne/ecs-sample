# Entity/Component/System sample

This is a sample game developed using an Entity-Component-System architecture, as part of [my talk on creating games with entities and components](https://speakerdeck.com/ddfreyne/creating-games-with-entities-and-components).

The code was written with simplicity in mind. It is not necessarily fast, future-proof, feature-complete or in any case ready to be used in a real-world game.

## Requirements

You will need:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (any recent version will do)
* [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/)

## Credits

The spaceship asset is made by [Kenney](http://www.kenney.nl/).
